* OPERATORS:

* Operators are what we use to act on out data. The can assign values, compare values

// 1. Assignment operators //
// Assignment operators are used to assign values to variable.
// They include assignment (=) addition assignment (+=) 	x = x + y
Subtraction assignment	x -= y	x = x - y
Multiplication assignment	x *= y	x = x * y
Division assignment	x /= y	x = x / y
Remainder assignment	x %= y 

// 2. Arithmetic operators //

// 3. Comparison operators //

// 4. Logical operators //

// 5. Unary operators (!, typeOf, -) //

// 6. Ternary operator (a ? b : c) //
